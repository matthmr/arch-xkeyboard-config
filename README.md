# NOTE

This is the mh fork of arch's xkeyboard-config package. My changes are mostly
for my use-case only.

The master branch is not where most of the action occurs, instead, look for the
relevant version you want as a tag, then see if an equivalent `mh-*` version
exists as well. For example: version 2.43-1 has mh-2.43-1 as its mh equivalent.
Thoses forks are kept in the `pkg` branch.
